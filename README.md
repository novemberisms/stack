# stack.go

This is my implementation of a LIFO stack in Go. Who hasn't made one of these? 

Supports the following methods:

* Push
    Pushes a value unto the stack
* Pop
    Pops a value from the top of the stack
* Peek
    Gets the top element of the stack without popping it
* Bottom
    Gets the bottom element of the stack without popping it
* Contains
    Tests whether a value is in the stack
* PopFirst
    Pops the first value from the top of the stack that matches the given element
* PopLast
    Pops the first value from the bottom of the stack that matches the given element
